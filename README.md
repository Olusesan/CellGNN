# CellGNN

**CellGNN** is an accurate and scalable cell tracking library that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model spatiotemporal relationships between cells. By treating cells as nodes and their spatial or lineage relationships as edges, CellGNN achieves state of the art performance on dynamic cell tracking tasks.
